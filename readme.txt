Usage Instructions:

Clone repo.
While in repo directory, run

python git_clone_from_list.py CS362_S18_onids_and_github_usernames.txt -assignment_num 2

You can add your students github usernames in CS362_S18_onids_and_github_usernames.txt

The -assignment_num flag is used to create the directory where all the folders are put

Currently, the script is hardcoded to branch to assignment 2, I may change this to be command line controlled in the future, or you can change it yourself
